   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>
     Hi! My name is Pau, which means "peace" in Catalan. I grew up in  
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardedeu"> Cardedeu</a>, 
     a small town in Catalonia, Spain. After completing the Spanish A-levels, I decided to study 
     Theoretical Physics at the University of Manchester. My passion for the field grew, and my achievements
     allowed me to pursue a Ph.D at the University of Liverpool, working on one of the 
     most exciting and unsolved mysteries in the Standard Model of Particle Physics: 
     <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/04/13/the-big-theoretical-physics-problem-at-the-center-of-the-muon-g-2-puzzle/"> 
     the muon g-2 anomaly</a>.
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of my achievements include getting the Tessella prize for best use of software in my Master's thesis, 
     completing the Spanish A-levels with Honours and getting a First Class in my degree. Outside of education and
     physics, I was part of the team that won the 2018 Catalan Debate League. 

    </p>
     In my free time I enjoy dancing salsa and bachata, as well as reading. I am also a big fan of
     programming, you can check some of my projects in the <a href=" projects.html">Projects</a>.
